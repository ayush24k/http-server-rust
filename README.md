### HTTP Web Server (from Scratch)

had a lot of fun building this HTTP server from scratch written in Rust.

Learned a lot of things like:
- How a TCP and HTTP Protocols work under the hood 
- What Information and How the Infromation is carried in an HTTP requests.
- Request Types and much more.

Used ThreadPooling Method to Handle multiple/limit requests.
